# profinder

profinder is a project build for a Github profile search application built using jQuery and JavaScript.

## Description

The app will use the Github API to make an AJAX request to fetch the user's profile information and repositories, and display them properly using Bootswatch(a custom theme service for bootstrap). 

This project is built with the objective of helping myself and others to gain a better understanding of jQuery and handling AJAX requests.

## Installation

- Click  [here](https://github.com/settings/application/new) to set up the new application with Github so your app does not stop when it gets to 50 requests per hour.
- Set homepage URL to http://localhost
- Set Authorization callback URL to http://localhost
